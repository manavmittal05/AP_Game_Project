# Tank Stars Game

This project is an implementation of the popular Tank Stars game in a 1 vs. 1 mode using the LibGDX game development framework. The game involves two players facing off on hilly terrain, taking turns firing bombs at each other. Players need to select the power and angle of the trajectory for their shots, strategically position themselves, and aim to destroy their opponent's tank.
